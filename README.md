## Introduction

Mom's Lifesaver is a baby sleeping audio tool designed to help soothe and calm your baby. The app provides a collection of carefully curated audio tracks including white noise, nature sounds, heartbeat rhythms, and shushing sounds that can be played individually or combined to create the perfect calming environment.

The app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), making it available across platforms.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Audio Tracks**: Choose from a growing library of different soothing sounds including rain, water streams, kalimba music, heartbeat, and shushing sounds
- **Simultaneous Playback**: Play multiple tracks at the same time to create custom sound combinations
- **Individual Volume Control**: Adjust the volume of each track independently for fine-tuned audio mixing
- **Master Volume Control**: Quickly adjust the overall volume of all playing tracks with a single slider
- **Background Audio**: Audio continues playing when you switch apps or lock your device
- **Smart Track Selection**: Select tracks with a tap, then control them all together with play/pause and stop buttons
- **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Android and Web browsers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- For mobile development:
  - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS/Android device, OR
  - iOS Simulator (macOS only) / Android Emulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FilipeLopesPires/MomsLifesaver.git
   cd MomsLifesaver
   ```

2. **Navigate to the app directory**
   ```bash
   cd src/MomsLifesaver
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Run on your preferred platform**
   - Press `w` for web
   - Press `a` for Android (requires Android emulator or device)
   - Press `i` for iOS (requires iOS simulator or device)
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

### Development Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run web` - Start web development server
- `npm run android` - Run on Android
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS
- `npm run export:web` - Export static web build to `docs/` folder
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Building and Testing the Web Export

To build a static version of the web app for deployment:

1. **Export the web build**
   ```bash
   cd src/MomsLifesaver
   npm run export:web
   ```
   This creates a `docs` folder at the repository root with static files ready for deployment.

2. **Test the exported build locally**
   
   **Using npx (recommended, no installation needed):**
   ```bash
   # From repository root
   npx serve docs -p 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
   
   **Alternative methods:**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   cd docs
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js http-server (if installed globally)
   cd docs
   http-server -p 8000
   ```

3. **Verify the build**
   - App loads correctly
   - Audio tracks are visible and playable
   - Volume controls work
   - No console errors in browser DevTools

The `docs` folder is automatically generated by GitHub Actions on each push to `main` and deployed to GitHub Pages. You don't need to commit the `docs` folder manually.
